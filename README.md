# somftcraft ![Build](https://github.com/DeflatedPickle/somftcraft/actions/workflows/gradle-build.yml/badge.svg)
a minecraft overhaul for all i think of

## what it do tho
- mobs can be set on fire directly
- mobs on fire spread said fire
- shows extra info for held items
- lower armour stops berry bushes hurting
- crouch click vehicles to pick them up
- recently fed animals loose interest in food
- milking has a delay
- entity knock back velocity based on their size
- flowers are edible but disgusting
- lit blocks spread fire
